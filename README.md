# Simple_Life_Expectancy_Visualizer
A simple visualizer estimating how much time in months you have left on this planet.
This may help you realize and get motivated to do what you want to do and be who you want to be. 

To use the program, you may need to change the width and height (display size), block_size, and block_gap.
You will need to change the life_expectancy (in years) and your birthdate.
You may also want to change the output location of the picture.

Feel free to play with the code and change bunches of stuff to your heart content.

I got my motivation to write a code from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w6GLvaAdCQ

Let me know if you have any questions.
Got to go to chase my dream~!
